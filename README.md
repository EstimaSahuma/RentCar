# Django REST APIs with DRF

An example RESTful API built using Django 2.2

## Best Practices for Designing a Pragmatic RESTful API

    Use RESTful URLs and actions
    Version via the URL, not via headers
    HATEOAS
    Use query parameters for advanced filtering, sorting & searching
    Limit which fields are returned from the API
    Return something useful from POST, PATCH & PUT requests
    Pretty print by default & gzip supported
    Consider using JSON for POST, PUT and PATCH request bodies
    Paginate using Link headers
    Use token based authentication
    Include response headers that facilitate caching
    Effectively use HTTP Status codes
